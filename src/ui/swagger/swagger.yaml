              Retrieves a valid token to be used in requests.
              The authentication approach is following the 
              which is a standard _[(RFC-7519)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)_that defines how to transmit and store
              JSON objects in a compact and secure way between different applications.
              
              The token payload will include the following information _[(RFC-7519)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#page-8)_:
              - **sub** (subject) - Entity to which the token belongs, usually the user Id;
              - **sub_type** - Defines the type of user to which the token belongs;
              - **iss** (issuer) - Defines the issuer of the token;
              - **iat** (issued on) - Timestamp in seconds of when the token was created;
              - **scope** - Specifies the access scopes that the generated token has.
              - **exp** (expiration) - Timestamp in seconds of when the token will expire;
              
              
              Example of values that can make up the payload:
              ```json
              {
                'sub': '5accb6215ba48413e81e7853e',

        To filter a collection by multiple concurrent attributes or filter multiple values for an attribute,
        simply use the attribute/property name with an equal sign and the expected values (separated by a comma):
        **_property=value1,value2,value3_**. The query is not case sensitive.

        Example: **_?type=direct_** to retrieve exactly the items with direct type.

        For filtering with logical operators, just follow the syntax:

        **_property=operator:value_**. The available operators are:
         - **gt** -> Searches for items that have the attribute with a value greater than the specified (that is, >).
         - **gte** -> Searches for items that have the attribute with a value greater than or equal to the one specified (that is, >=).
         - **lt** -> Searches for items that have the attribute with a value less than the specified value (that is, <).
         - **lte** -> Searches for items that have the attribute with a value less than or equal to the one specified (that is, <=).

        Example: **_?value=gte:800&value=lt:1200_** to retrieve items with a value greater than or equal to 800 and less than 1200.
